      THE PORT2PORT MARKETPLACE EXPLAINED…
    </h2>
  
    <p class="tagline">
      Port2Port offers you the biggest online selection of fine wines from around the world at the best possible prices while guaranteeing cellaring conditions and provenance. In order to do so, we do not operate from a centralized warehouse, but rather collect your wines from the winery or retailer warehouse and ship directly to your door. This means that when you shop from multiple sellers you may receive your order in separate shipments, the number of which will be indicated on checkout.
